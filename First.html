<u>To make your document look professionally produced, Word provides header, <strong>footer, cover page, and text box designs that complement each other.</strong> For example<br>  <mark><strong><a href ="https://faebook.com"target="_blank"> <br>Facebook Open</mak></strong></a> <br>You can add a matching cover page, header, and sidebar. Click Insert and then choose the elements you want from the different galleries.<br><em ></strong>
<mark>Themes and styles also help keep your document coordinated. When you click Design and choose a new Theme, the pictures, charts, and SmartArt graphics change to match your new theme. When you apply styles, your headings change to match the new theme.</em></mark>
<p style = "color :Yellow;"><u>Save time in Word with new buttons that show up where you need them. To change the way a picture fits in your document, click it and a button for 
layout options appears next to it. When you work on a table, click where you want to add a row or a column, and then click the plus sign.</p></u>
<p style ="color :pink;"><del>Reading is easier, too, in the new Reading <mark>view.</mark> You can collapse parts of the document and focus on the <u>text </u>you want. If you need to stop reading before you reach the end, Word remembers where you left off - even on another device.</p></del>
